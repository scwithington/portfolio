# Advanced CSS: Portfolio
## Description
This is my professional portfolio. Compared to the last edit, I made quite a few changes. I separated each section into its own html page (now including a blog), added my logo which redirects to the homepage, added non-copyright images which I applied to a slideshow on the homepage, and created a visually appealing, functional navbar.
