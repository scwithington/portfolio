                <p>Now that the spring quarter is coming to an end, I will be able to focus more on game development. I have been considering the idea of using flat-shading to create a 2D look for the rogue-like. One option could be as simple as doing toon-shaders. I will continue to research this topic because I imagine it would work well with the theme of the game. Until I have the means to compile the game, I will continue soft development on paper.</p>

My current project consists of a rogue-like game with simple souls-like gameplay. Animations for spear and sword movesets have already been implemented and I have made much progress in concept and storyboard but so far, only 2 enemies have been modelled and animated.
